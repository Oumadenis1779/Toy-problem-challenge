# Toy-problem challenge

This repository contains Python solutions for three coding challenges. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of programming logic.

## Challenge 1: 12-hour to 24-hour Time Conversion

### Task:
Convert a given 12-hour time to 24-hour time format.

### Function Signature:
def convert_to_24_hour_format(hour, minute, period):
    # implementation
 
 # Challenge 2: Two Numbers are Positive

### Task:
  Write a function that returns True if exactly two out of three integers are positive, and False otherwise.

### Function signature

  def exactly_two_positive(a, b, c):
    # implementation
 This function counts how many of the three numbers are positive and returns True if the count is exactly 2, and False otherwise.

  Example:
  exactly_two_positive(2, 4, -3) returns True
  exactly_two_positive(-4, 6, 0) returns False


# Challenge 3: Constant value
## Task
Given a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only, return the highest value of consonant substrings.

# Function signature

 def solve(s):
    # implementation
    This function calculates the values of consonant substrings and finds the highest value among them. It uses a dictionary to map each consonant to its corresponding value and iterates through all possible substrings to find their values and determine the maximum.
